# hades_ioc_scanner
A python based IOC scanner with web interface, supporting Stix and OpenIoc.

This project was my bachelor's thesis for my BSC degree at Budapest University of Technology. The code is in general poor condition, mostly a proof of concept, however it is, even in its current state, capable of processing IOC files and detecting basic IOC types.
